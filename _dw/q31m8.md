  I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're
  doing these little delicate things. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a
  whisper floating across a mountain. Clouds are free. They just float around
  the sky all day and have fun. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.
  We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.

lernziele: "We have a fantastic little sky! Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Brown is such a nice color.\r\n\r\nDon't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. We'll have a super time.\r\n\r\nThat's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind."
tipp: "Even the worst thing we can do here is good. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. There comes a nice little fluffer. Water's like me. It's laaazy√Ç ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things\r\n\r\nOnly God can make a tree - but you can paint one. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. I like to beat the brush."
