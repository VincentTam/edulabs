  Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework
  first. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. I can't
  think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others
  through painting. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here.

  Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Just let this happen. We just let this
  flow right out of our minds. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.
  Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Use
  absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.
tipp: "Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Son of a gun. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.\r\n\r\nDon't fiddle with it all day. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. At home you have unlimited time. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen."
